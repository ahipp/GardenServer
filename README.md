# GardenServer

The current plan is for this repository to contain javascript code for running an expressJS server on the raspberry pi, and groovy code for communicating with the raspberry pi via SmartThings.

The SmartThings groovy code is added with GitHub integration to SmartThings IDE, which puts it into a weird folder structure.
